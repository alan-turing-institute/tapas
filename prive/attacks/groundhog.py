"""
This file implements the Groundhog attack, as introduced in:
    Stadler, T., Oprisanu, B. and Troncoso, C., 2021. Synthetic dataâ€“anonymisation
    groundhog day. In 31st USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 22).

The Groundhog attack is a black-box attack based on shadow modelling that
uses a combination of three set features (Naive, Hist and Corr) and a random
forest as learner.
