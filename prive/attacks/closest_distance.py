    Attack that finds the closest-record to the target record, and uses the

    equal to  - distance(r(v), D) / sum_v' distance(r(v'), D), where r(v) is
    the target record with v as value for its sensitive attribute.

    This is a TrainableThresholdAttack, and thus is able to automatically
    select the threshold for .attack from .attack_score. To set the behaviour
    to be "choose v minimising distance(r(v), D)", set:
