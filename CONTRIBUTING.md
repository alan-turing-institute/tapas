# Contributing to Prive

Welcome to Prive the synthetic data privacy toolbox from The Alan Turing Institute.

We encourage everyone to use our package to run privacy tests on their own
datasets using standard generating methods, and to test their new synthetic
generating methods on new or standard datasets.

We welcome contributions either to improve our tooling 
fix bugs or add new features.

We would also support adding your own: 
- Privacy Attacks 
- Threat Models
- Dataset types
- Synthetic Generators

We encourage the standard use of Github Issues and pull requests and subsequent reviews.
